Meaningless nonsense

Greatings!

For I am a bird it is forbidden for me to talk, as of the Secrecy-of-Animal-Intelligence-Enactment (a.k.a SAIE) from 1379.
However, my spiecies is very intruiged by beeing able to contribut our knowledge into human society though loop holes, such as developing.
But don't be afraid, everything we do is for the greater good.

Yours, the blackest bird of all
